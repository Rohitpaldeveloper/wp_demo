A full-stack developer is a developer or engineer who can build both the front end and the back end of a website. The front end (the parts of a website a user sees and interacts with) and the back end (the behind-the-scenes data storage and processing) require different skill sets.

Full Stack Web Developer Masters Program by Edureka (Link in bio) will enable you to build interactive and responsive web applications using both front-end and back-end technologies.
